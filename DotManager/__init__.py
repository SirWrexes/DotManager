    Oh well. I don't have any code to execute at load time (yet).
    Anyway, this file is not interesting. Why are you still reading ?
    I can go on and on for hours you know ?
    Lorem ipsum sit dolor amet- No I'm kidding, I wouldn't reduce myself
    to such laziness.
    I hope you're having a great time. Are you ? Plese tell me you are.
    If not, then I *really* wonder why you keep reading.
    Alright. I'm out of ideas... for now.
    See ya !

    Hello again. I had a great day today. I've improved the performance
    of my code as well as its readability, but I've been struggling with
    finding an efficient way to merge two JSON files in order to update
    one with the other, without overwriting its keys and with skipping
    those that already exist and have nothing changed about them.
    Alright. That's enough fooling around. Back to it !
